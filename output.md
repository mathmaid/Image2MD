**Exercise 3.12**.: Let $(M^{n},g)$ be a one-ended asymptotically flat manifold, and suppose that $u$ is a smooth positive function on $M$ such that in the asymptotically flat coordinate chart, we have

$$u(x)=1+O_{2}(|x|^{-q})$$

for some $q>\frac{n-2}{2}$. Further assume that $\Delta_{g}u\in L^{1}$. Prove that $\tilde{g}=u^{\frac{4}{n-2}}g$ is also an asymptotically flat metric on $M$, and that its ADM mass is

$$m_{\rm ADM}(\tilde{g})=m_{\rm ADM}(g)+\lim_{\rho\to\infty}\frac{-2}{(n-1)\omega_{n-1}}\int_{S_{\rho}}\frac{\partial u}{\partial r}\overline{d\mu}_{S_{\rho}}.$$
